**Title: Reverse a String**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to reverse a given string by swapping its characters from the beginning to the end.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm reverses the string by swapping characters from both ends. It iterates through half of the string's length and swaps the characters at symmetric positions (i and length - 1 - i) in the string. This effectively reverses the entire string.

1. Convert the input string `str` to a character array `ch`.

2. Iterate through the first half of the string (up to length / 2):
   - Swap the character at position `i` with the character at position `length - 1 - i`, where `length` is the length of the string.

3. After the iteration is complete, the character array `ch` contains the reversed string.

4. Convert the character array `ch` back to a string and return it.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm efficiently reverses the given string using the approach of swapping characters from both ends. By iterating through half of the string and swapping characters symmetrically, it effectively achieves the desired reversal.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm iterates through half of the characters in the string, performing constant-time swap operations. Therefore, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input string.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses extra space to store the character array, which has a space complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the input string.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code successfully reverses the given string by swapping its characters using a simple and efficient algorithm. The approach of symmetric swapping allows the algorithm to achieve the reversal in linear time complexity.
