**Title: Longest K Unique Characters Substring**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to find the length of the longest substring in a given string `s` that contains at most `k` distinct characters.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm employs a sliding window approach along with a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of characters within the current window.

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to denote the left and right boundaries of the sliding window. Initialize an empty hashmap `map` to store character frequencies.

2. Initialize a variable `maxLength` to keep track of the maximum length of the desired substring.

3. Iterate while the right pointer `j` is within the bounds of the string.

4. In each iteration:
   - Increment the frequency of the character at index `j` in the hashmap. If the character is not present in the hashmap, set its frequency to 1.
   - If the number of distinct characters in the hashmap exceeds `k`, enter a loop to reduce the window size by incrementing the left pointer `i`. Decrease the frequency of the character at index `i` in the hashmap and remove it if its frequency becomes zero.

5. If the size of the hashmap (number of distinct characters) equals `k`, calculate the length of the current substring as `j - i + 1` and update `maxLength` accordingly.

6. Continue to increment the right pointer `j`.

7. Finally, return the maximum length stored in `maxLength`.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm maintains a sliding window that iteratively adjusts its size to ensure that the number of distinct characters within the window does not exceed `k`. By keeping track of character frequencies in the hashmap and comparing the size of the hashmap with `k`, the algorithm identifies valid substrings and updates the maximum length accordingly.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm traverses the string twice (using `i` and `j` pointers) while performing constant-time operations on the hashmap. Hence, the overall time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the string.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses additional space to store characters and their frequencies in the hashmap. In the worst case, when all characters are distinct, the hashmap can contain `k` entries. Therefore, the space complexity is O(k).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively determines the length of the longest substring in the given string `s` that contains at most `k` distinct characters. By utilizing the sliding window approach and maintaining a hashmap to track character frequencies, the algorithm identifies valid substrings and calculates their lengths while ensuring the number of distinct characters stays within the specified limit.
