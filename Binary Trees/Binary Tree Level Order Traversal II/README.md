**Title: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II**

**Introduction:**
The provided code defines a solution to perform a level-order traversal of a binary tree in a bottom-up manner. In this traversal, the elements at each level are stored in separate lists, and the lists are arranged in reverse order of their appearance in the tree.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm for performing a level-order traversal of a binary tree in a bottom-up manner is implemented using a combination of a queue and a stack. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Initialize a queue to perform a regular level-order traversal, a stack to store the elements in a bottom-up fashion, and a list called `level` to store elements at each level temporarily.

2. Start with the root node. If the root node is not null, enqueue it into the queue.

3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   - Get the number of nodes in the current level by storing the queue's size.
   - Push a `null` element onto the stack to mark the end of the current level.
   - For each node in the current level:
     - Dequeue a node from the queue.
     - Push the node onto the stack.
     - Enqueue the right child of the node (if it exists).
     - Enqueue the left child of the node (if it exists).

4. Create a list called `levelorder` to store the level-order traversal in a bottom-up manner.

5. Pop elements from the stack one by one:
   - If the element is not `null`, add its value to the `level` list.
   - If the element is `null`, it marks the end of a level. Add the `level` list to the `levelorder` list and create a new empty `level` list.

6. Continue popping elements from the stack and adding them to the `level` list until the stack is empty.

7. Finally, return the `levelorder` list, which contains the level-order traversal in a bottom-up fashion.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once during the traversal.
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This represents the space used by the queue and stack during traversal.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers a solution for performing a level-order traversal of a binary tree in a bottom-up manner. It uses a combination of a queue and a stack to achieve this. The resulting list contains the elements at each level arranged in reverse order of their appearance in the tree. This approach is efficient and provides a convenient way to obtain a bottom-up level-order traversal.
