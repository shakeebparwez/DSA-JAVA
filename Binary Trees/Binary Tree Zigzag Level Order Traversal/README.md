**Title: Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal**

**Introduction:**
The provided code defines a solution to perform a zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree. In this traversal, elements at each level are stored in separate lists, and the direction of traversal alternates between left to right and right to left at each level.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm for performing a zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree is implemented using a deque (double-ended queue) to facilitate both left-to-right and right-to-left traversal. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Initialize a list called `zigzag` to store the zigzag level order traversal and a deque called `dq` to perform the traversal. Also, initialize a temporary pointer `temp` to the root node.

2. If the root node is not null, enqueue it into the `dq` (initial traversal direction: left to right).

3. Initialize a boolean variable `isLeftToRight` to `true`, indicating the initial traversal direction.

4. While the `dq` is not empty, do the following:
   - Create an `ArrayList` called `level` to store elements at the current level.
   - Get the size of the `dq` (number of nodes in the current level).

5. For each node in the current level (based on the traversal direction):
   - If `isLeftToRight` is `true` (left to right traversal):
     - Dequeue a node from the front of the `dq`.
     - Add the node's value to the `level` list.
     - Enqueue its left and then right child to the back of the `dq` if they exist.
   - If `isLeftToRight` is `false` (right to left traversal):
     - Dequeue a node from the back of the `dq`.
     - Add the node's value to the `level` list.
     - Enqueue its right and then left child to the front of the `dq` if they exist.

6. After processing all nodes in the current level, add the `level` list to the `zigzag` list.

7. Reverse the direction of traversal by toggling the `isLeftToRight` variable.

8. Continue this process until the `dq` is empty.

9. Finally, return the `zigzag` list, which contains the zigzag level order traversal of the binary tree.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once during the traversal.
- The space complexity is O(w), where w is the maximum width (number of nodes at the widest level) of the binary tree. This represents the space used by the deque during traversal.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers a solution for performing a zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree. It uses a deque to facilitate alternating traversal directions (left to right and right to left) at each level. The resulting list contains the elements at each level arranged in a zigzag pattern. This approach efficiently handles the zigzag traversal of the binary tree.
