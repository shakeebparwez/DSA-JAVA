**Title: Find Bottom Left Tree Value**

**Introduction:**
The provided code defines a solution to find and return the leftmost node's value in the bottom level of a binary tree. This problem involves traversing the tree and identifying the leftmost node at the maximum depth.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm for finding the bottom-left node's value in the binary tree is implemented using a depth-first traversal (preorder) approach. The main steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Define two global variables: `maxDepth` and `leftmost`, both initially set to -1. These variables will be used to keep track of the maximum depth reached during traversal and the value of the leftmost node at that depth.

2. Implement a recursive function, `recursiveLeftView(TreeNode root, int depth)`, that takes the current node (`root`) and its depth as parameters.

3. In the recursive function:
   - Check if the current node (`root`) is not null.
   - If the current depth (`depth`) is greater than `maxDepth`, update `maxDepth` to the current depth and set `leftmost` to the value of the current node (`root.val`). This step ensures that we track the leftmost node at the maximum depth.
   - Recursively call `recursiveLeftView` on the left child of the current node with an incremented depth (`depth + 1`).
   - Recursively call `recursiveLeftView` on the right child of the current node with an incremented depth (`depth + 1`).

4. Initialize the global variables `maxDepth` and `leftmost` to -1.

5. Invoke the `recursiveLeftView` function with the root of the binary tree and an initial depth of 0.

6. Return the value stored in the `leftmost` variable, which corresponds to the leftmost node at the maximum depth.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we perform a depth-first traversal of the entire tree, visiting each node once.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, when the tree is completely unbalanced (skewed), the height h can be equal to n (number of nodes), resulting in a space complexity of O(n). In the average case, when the tree is balanced, the height h is limited by the maximum depth of the tree, which is typically less than n.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers an efficient solution to find the value of the leftmost node in the bottom level of a binary tree. It utilizes a depth-first traversal approach to track the maximum depth reached and the corresponding leftmost node's value during the traversal process. This approach ensures that the leftmost node at the maximum depth is correctly identified and returned as the result.
