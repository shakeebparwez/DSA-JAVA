**Title: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal**

**Introduction:**
The provided code demonstrates two methods for performing an inorder traversal on a binary tree: a recursive approach and an iterative approach using a stack.

**Algorithm:**
In-order traversal is a way to traverse a binary tree in which each node is visited in the order of left subtree, node, and then right subtree.

1. **Recursive Inorder Traversal (`recursiveInorder`):**
   - If the current node is not null:
     - Recursively traverse the left subtree.
     - Add the value of the current node to the `inorder` list.
     - Recursively traverse the right subtree.
   - The base case is when the node is null, in which case the function terminates.

2. **Iterative Inorder Traversal (`iterativeInorder`):**
   - Initialize a temporary pointer `temp` with the root of the tree.
   - Create a stack (`stk`) to store nodes as they are being traversed.
   - Iterate while `temp` is not null or the stack is not empty:
     - If `temp` is not null:
       - Push `temp` onto the stack and move `temp` to its left child.
     - If `temp` is null:
       - Pop the top node from the stack, add its value to the `inorder` list, and move `temp` to its right child.

3. **Inorder Traversal (`inorderTraversal`):**
   - Create an empty list `inorder` to store the result.
   - Call either the `recursiveInorder` function or the `iterativeInorder` function based on the chosen approach.
   - Return the `inorder` list.

**Explanation:**
Both the recursive and iterative approaches perform an inorder traversal on the binary tree and store the result in the `inorder` list.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: Both approaches visit each node exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Space Complexity: The recursive approach uses the call stack for recursion, which takes up space proportional to the height of the binary tree. The iterative approach uses a stack to keep track of nodes, also resulting in space proportional to the height of the binary tree. Therefore, the space complexity for both approaches is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code provides two efficient methods to perform an inorder traversal on a binary tree: a recursive approach and an iterative approach using a stack. Both methods ensure that the nodes are visited in the correct order, resulting in an accurate inorder traversal of the tree.
