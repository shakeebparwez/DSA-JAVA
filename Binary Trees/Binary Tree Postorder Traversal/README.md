**Title: Binary Tree Postorder Traversal**

**Introduction:**
The provided code implements both a recursive and an iterative solution for performing postorder traversal on a binary tree. Postorder traversal involves visiting the nodes in the order left -> right -> root.

**Algorithm - Recursive Approach:**
The recursive approach performs postorder traversal by recursively traversing the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally adding the root node's value to the list.

1. If the current node is not null:
   - Recursively traverse the left subtree by calling `recursivePostorder(root.left, postorder)`.
   - Recursively traverse the right subtree by calling `recursivePostorder(root.right, postorder)`.
   - Add the value of the current root node to the `postorder` list using `postorder.add(root.val)`.

**Algorithm - Iterative Approach:**
The iterative approach utilizes a stack to simulate the recursive call stack and ensures the postorder traversal order.

1. Initialize a stack of type `Pair` (where each pair contains a `TreeNode` and a boolean `flag`).
2. Push the root node along with a flag value of `false` onto the stack.
3. While the stack is not empty or the current node is not null:
   - If the current node is not null:
     - Push a pair with the current node and a flag value of `true` onto the stack.
     - Move to the left child by updating the current node as `currentNode.left`.
   - If the current node is null, pop a pair from the stack:
     - If the pair's flag value is `true`, add the node's value to the `postorder` list.
     - Set the current node as `null`.
4. Return the `postorder` list containing the postorder traversal values.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Both recursive and iterative approaches visit each node once. Therefore, the time complexity of both approaches is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- In terms of space complexity, the recursive approach utilizes the call stack, which can go as deep as the height of the tree. The iterative approach uses an explicit stack, which also contributes to space usage. Hence, both approaches have a space complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers two different approaches, recursive and iterative, to perform postorder traversal on a binary tree. Both approaches ensure that the traversal follows the desired order of visiting nodes (left -> right -> root). These approaches can be selected based on the specific requirements of the application and its constraints.
