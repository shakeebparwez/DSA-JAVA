**Title: Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to find and return the vertical order traversal of a binary tree. In the vertical order traversal, nodes at the same vertical position (column) are grouped together and sorted by their row and value.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm for performing a vertical order traversal of the binary tree is implemented using a breadth-first traversal approach along with the use of data structures for organizing the nodes by their column, row, and value. The main steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Create a `Tuple` class to represent a node in the tree along with its coordinates (row and column). The class should include fields for the node itself (`node`), its row (`row`), and its column (`col`).

2. Define a `TreeMap` called `map` to store the nodes based on their column (`col`). The `map` will map columns to another `TreeMap`, which maps rows to a `PriorityQueue` of node values. This data structure will ensure that nodes with the same column are sorted by their row and value.

3. Create a `Queue` called `queue` to perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree. Initialize the queue by adding the root node with coordinates (0,0) to represent the root's column and row.

4. Perform the breadth-first traversal:
   - Remove a `Tuple` (`curr`) from the front of the queue.
   - Check if the `map` does not contain the current column (`curr.col`). If not, add an entry for this column to the `map`.
   - Check if the inner `TreeMap` associated with the current column (`map.get(curr.col)`) does not contain the current row (`curr.row`). If not, add an entry for this row to the inner `TreeMap`.
   - Get the `PriorityQueue` corresponding to the current column and row and add the value of the current node (`curr.node.val`) to it. This ensures nodes with the same column are sorted by their row and value.
   - If the left child of the current node exists, enqueue it with adjusted coordinates (row + 1, col - 1) to represent a left child.
   - If the right child of the current node exists, enqueue it with adjusted coordinates (row + 1, col + 1) to represent a right child.

5. Create a 2D `ArrayList` called `verticaltraversal` to store the nodes in vertical order.

6. Iterate through the `map` by taking its values (inner `TreeMap`) in sorted order based on columns.
   - For each column, create a temporary `ArrayList<Integer>` called `temp` to store the nodes at that column.
   - Iterate through the inner `TreeMap` by taking its values (priority queues) in sorted order based on rows.
   - For each row, empty the priority queue, adding the nodes' values to the `temp` list.
   - Add the `temp` list to the `verticaltraversal`.

7. Return the `verticaltraversal`, which contains the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * log(m)), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, and m is the maximum number of columns in the vertical order. In the worst case, when m is proportional to n (completely unbalanced tree), the time complexity is O(n^2 * log(n)).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n * log(m)) in the worst case due to the use of data structures such as the `map` and `PriorityQueue`. However, in the average case, when the tree is balanced, the space complexity is reduced to O(n) because the number of columns is limited by the height of the tree.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers an efficient solution to perform a vertical order traversal of a binary tree, ensuring that nodes with the same column are sorted by their row and value. The algorithm utilizes data structures such as `TreeMap` and `PriorityQueue` to organize and sort the nodes correctly.
