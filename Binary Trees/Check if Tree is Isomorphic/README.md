The provided code defines a function `isIsomorphic` that checks whether two binary trees (`root1` and `root2`) are isomorphic to each other. Two binary trees are considered isomorphic if they have a symmetric structure when their nodes are swapped without changing the structure.

Here's how the code works:

1. The `isIsomorphic` function takes two parameters: `root1` and `root2`, which are the roots of the two binary trees being compared.

2. There are three main conditions to consider:
   - If both `root1` and `root2` are `null`, they are considered isomorphic, and the function returns `true`.
   - If one of `root1` or `root2` is `null` while the other is not, they are not isomorphic, and the function returns `false`.
   - If both `root1` and `root2` are not `null`, the function checks three conditions:
     - Condition 1: It compares the data values of the current nodes (`root1.data` and `root2.data`). If they are not equal, the trees cannot be isomorphic, and the function returns `false`.

     - Condition 2: It recursively checks whether the left subtrees of both trees (`root1.left` and `root2.left`) and the right subtrees of both trees (`root1.right` and `root2.right`) are isomorphic.

     - Condition 3: It recursively checks whether the left subtree of one tree (`root1.left`) and the right subtree of the other tree (`root2.right`) are isomorphic, and whether the right subtree of one tree (`root1.right`) and the left subtree of the other tree (`root2.left`) are isomorphic.

3. If either Condition 2 or Condition 3 is true (i.e., the trees are isomorphic according to one of these conditions), the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Overall, this code recursively compares the structure of two binary trees by examining their nodes and their subtrees. It checks both the condition where the subtrees are in the same arrangement and the condition where the subtrees are swapped, which covers all possible isomorphic cases.

This code correctly determines whether two binary trees are isomorphic or not.
