**Title: Binary Tree Right Side View**

**Introduction:**
The provided code defines a solution for obtaining the right side view of a binary tree. The right side view consists of all the nodes that are visible when looking at the tree from the right-hand side at each level.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm for obtaining the right side view of a binary tree is implemented using a recursive approach. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Initialize an `ArrayList` called `rightview` to store the right side view of the binary tree.

2. Create a recursive function called `recursiveRightView` that takes three parameters:
   - `root`: The current node in the traversal.
   - `level`: The current level of the node.
   - `rightview`: The list to store the right side view.

3. Inside the `recursiveRightView` function:
   - Check if the `root` node is not null.

   - If the `rightview` list's size is equal to the current `level`, it means that this is the first node encountered at this level from the right side. In this case, add the `root` node's value to the `rightview` list.

   - Recursively call the `recursiveRightView` function for the right child of the current node, incrementing the `level` by 1.

   - Recursively call the `recursiveRightView` function for the left child of the current node, incrementing the `level` by 1.

4. Call the `recursiveRightView` function initially with the `root` node, starting `level` at 0, and passing the `rightview` list.

5. After the recursive calls, the `rightview` list will contain the right side view of the binary tree.

6. Return the `rightview` list as the result.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the traversal.
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This represents the maximum depth of the call stack during the recursive traversal.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers a solution for obtaining the right side view of a binary tree. It uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and identify the nodes visible from the right side at each level. The resulting list contains the values of the visible nodes, providing the right side view of the binary tree.
