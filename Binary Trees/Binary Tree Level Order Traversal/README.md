**Title: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal**

**Introduction:**
The provided code implements an approach to perform level order traversal on a binary tree. In level order traversal, nodes at the same level are visited before moving on to the nodes at the next level.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm uses a queue to keep track of nodes at each level. The process involves iterating through each level, adding nodes to the queue, and then processing them to populate the level's values in the final result.

1. Initialize an empty queue to store the nodes for level order traversal.
2. Create a 2D list named `levelorder` to store the results.
3. If the root node is not null, add it to the queue.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   - Initialize an empty list named `level` to store the values of nodes at the current level.
   - Get the size of the queue to determine the number of nodes at the current level.
   - Iterate through the nodes in the queue for the current level:
     - Remove a node from the front of the queue.
     - Add the value of the node to the `level` list.
     - If the left child of the node is not null, add it to the queue.
     - If the right child of the node is not null, add it to the queue.
   - Add the `level` list to the `levelorder` list.
5. Return the `levelorder` list containing the level order traversal results.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Since each node is visited once and added to the queue once, the time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- The space complexity is determined by the maximum number of nodes that can be present at the same level in the queue. In the worst case, all nodes of the last level will be in the queue, resulting in a space complexity of O(w), where w is the maximum width of the binary tree.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers an efficient approach to perform level order traversal on a binary tree. By utilizing a queue to manage nodes at each level, the algorithm ensures that nodes are processed in the order they appear, producing the desired level order traversal result.
