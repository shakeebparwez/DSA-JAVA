**Title: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree**

**Introduction:**
The provided code defines a solution to find the maximum depth (height) of a binary tree using a recursive approach. The maximum depth of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm for finding the maximum depth of a binary tree is implemented using a recursive function called `maxDepth`. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. If the root node is not null:
   - Recursively calculate the maximum depth of the left subtree by calling `maxDepth(root.left)`.
   - Recursively calculate the maximum depth of the right subtree by calling `maxDepth(root.right)`.
   - Return the maximum of the left and right subtree depths plus 1 (to account for the current node).
2. If the root node is null, return 0 because there are no nodes, and the depth is 0.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once during the recursive traversal.
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This represents the maximum depth of the call stack during the recursive traversal.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers an efficient solution for finding the maximum depth of a binary tree. It recursively calculates the depths of the left and right subtrees and returns the maximum depth, taking into account the current node. This approach provides an accurate and fast way to determine the height of a binary tree.
