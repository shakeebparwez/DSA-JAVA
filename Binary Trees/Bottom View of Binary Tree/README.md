**Title: Bottom View of Binary Tree**

**Introduction:**
The provided code defines a solution to find and return the bottom view of a Binary Tree. The bottom view of a binary tree consists of the nodes visible from the bottom when viewed from left to right. It is the set of nodes that would be seen if we looked at the tree from the bottom, considering the horizontal distance of nodes from the root.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm for finding the bottom view of a Binary Tree is implemented using a level-order traversal and a HashMap to store nodes based on their horizontal distance from the root. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Create a class `Pair` to represent a pair of nodes along with their horizontal distance. Each pair consists of a `Node` and an `int` representing the horizontal distance.

2. Initialize a queue (`queue`) for level-order traversal and a HashMap (`map`) to store nodes based on their horizontal distance. Also, initialize two variables `min` and `max` to keep track of the horizontal distance range.

3. Put the root node into the `queue` with a horizontal distance of `0` to begin the traversal.

4. Traverse the tree while the `queue` is not empty:
   - Remove the current node (`curr`) from the `queue`.
   - If the horizontal distance of `curr` is not already in the `map`, add it to the `map` with the node's data.
   - If another node with the same horizontal distance is encountered (`map.containsKey(curr.horizontal_dist)`), update the node's data in the `map`. This ensures that the last node encountered at the same horizontal distance will be visible in the bottom view.
   - If the left child of `curr` exists, add it to the `queue` with a horizontal distance decreased by `1`. Update `min` if necessary.
   - If the right child of `curr` exists, add it to the `queue` with a horizontal distance increased by `1`. Update `max` if necessary.

5. Create an ArrayList (`ans`) to store the bottom view nodes.

6. Iterate from `min` to `max` and add the nodes from the `map` with these horizontal distances to the `ans` list.

7. Return the `ans` list, which contains the nodes visible from the bottom view of the Binary Tree.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree. This is because we perform a level-order traversal of the tree once, visiting each node once.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (number of nodes in the widest level). In the worst case, when the tree is completely unbalanced (skewed), w can be equal to n, resulting in a space complexity of O(n). In the average case, when the tree is balanced, w is limited by the maximum number of nodes at any level, which is typically less than n.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers a solution for finding the bottom view of a Binary Tree. It efficiently traverses the tree in a level-order fashion while keeping track of the horizontal distances of nodes from the root. The bottom view nodes are then extracted from the HashMap based on their horizontal distances, ensuring that the last node encountered at the same horizontal distance is visible in the bottom view.
