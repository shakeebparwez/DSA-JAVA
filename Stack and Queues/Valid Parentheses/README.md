**Title: Valid Parentheses**

**Introduction:**
The provided code checks whether a given string containing parentheses, curly brackets, and square brackets has valid parentheses grouping.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm follows these main steps:

1. **Stack for Opening Brackets:**
   - Create a stack (`stk`) to store the opening brackets encountered while iterating through the string.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '['), push it onto the stack.
     - If the character is a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'), check if the stack is empty. If it's not:
       - Compare the top of the stack (last pushed opening bracket) with the current closing bracket.
       - If they match, pop the top of the stack (matching opening bracket).
       - If they don't match, return `false` as the expression is invalid.
     - If the stack is empty and a closing bracket is encountered, return `false` as the expression is invalid.

3. **Check Stack and Return Result:**
   - After the iteration, check if the stack is empty:
     - If it's empty, all parentheses are balanced, and the expression is valid, so return `true`.
     - If it's not empty, some extra opening brackets are present, and the expression is invalid, so return `false`.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if there's a matching opening bracket on the top of the stack. If not, the expression is invalid. If the iteration completes and the stack is empty, the expression is valid.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm iterates through the string once, and stack operations take constant time on average. Thus, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input string.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a stack to store opening brackets, which requires space proportional to the number of opening brackets. In the worst case, this can be O(N) in case all characters are opening brackets. Therefore, the space complexity is O(N).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively checks the validity of parentheses grouping in a given string using a stack-based approach. It covers all possible scenarios, including mismatched brackets and extra opening brackets, providing a reliable solution for validating expressions.
