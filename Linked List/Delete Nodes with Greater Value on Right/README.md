**Title: Delete Nodes with Greater Value on Right**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to remove nodes from a linked list that have greater values on their right side. In other words, it retains only those nodes whose values are greater than or equal to all values on their right side.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm follows these key steps:

1. **Reverse the Linked List:**
   - Reverse the original linked list using the `reverseLL` function. This function reverses the linked list and returns the new head of the reversed list.

2. **Remove Nodes with Greater Values:**
   - Traverse the reversed linked list with `curr` and `prev` pointers. Also, maintain a variable `max_element` to keep track of the maximum value encountered so far.
   - For each node, check if its value is less than the `max_element`. If it is, remove the current node by updating `prev.next` to skip the current node.
   - If the value is greater or equal, update the `max_element` with the current node's value, move the `prev` pointer to the current node, and move the `curr` pointer to the next node.

3. **Reverse the Linked List Again:**
   - After removing the nodes with greater values on their right, reverse the linked list again using the `reverseLL` function to restore the original order.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm works by first reversing the linked list, then iterating through the reversed list to identify and remove nodes with greater values on their right. Finally, it reverses the modified list to obtain the desired result.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm performs three main operations: reversing the linked list (O(N)), removing nodes (O(N)), and reversing the list again (O(N)). Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N).
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables and pointer manipulation, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers an efficient solution to remove nodes from a linked list that have greater values on their right. It achieves this by first reversing the linked list, then iteratively identifying and removing nodes, and finally reversing the list again to obtain the desired outcome.
