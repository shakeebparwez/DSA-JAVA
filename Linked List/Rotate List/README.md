**Title: Rotate List**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to rotate a singly linked list to the right by a given number of steps `k`. The rotation involves moving the last `k` nodes to the front of the linked list.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm follows these main steps:

1. **Find Length and Form Circular List:**
   - Traverse the linked list to find its length (`length`).
   - Connect the last node's `next` pointer to the original `head` node, effectively forming a circular linked list.

2. **Determine Effective Rotations:**
   - Calculate the effective number of rotations required as `number_of_rotations_required = k % length`.

3. **Find New Head and Tail:**
   - Determine the node that will become the new `head` of the rotated list by moving `length - number_of_rotations_required` steps forward from the current `head`. Set `curr` to this node and `prev` to the previous node.

4. **Break Circular Connection:**
   - Update `prev.next` to `null`, breaking the circular connection and forming the new end of the rotated list.

5. **Update Head and Return:**
   - Update the `head` of the linked list to `curr`, as it becomes the new head of the rotated list.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm effectively rotates the linked list to the right by reassigning pointers. It calculates the effective number of rotations needed and finds the new head of the rotated list by traversing the list a specific number of steps. The circular connection is then broken to form the rotated list.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm traverses the linked list twice: once to find the length and form the circular list, and once to find the new head. Both traversals take O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables and pointer manipulation, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers an efficient solution to rotate a linked list to the right by a given number of steps. It effectively determines the new head of the rotated list and breaks the circular connection to produce the rotated result.
