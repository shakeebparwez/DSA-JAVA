**Title: Add Two Numbers**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to add two numbers represented as linked lists and return the result as a linked list.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm performs digit-wise addition by iterating through both linked lists simultaneously. It maintains a carry value that gets updated with each addition. The sum of the current digits and the carry results in a new digit to be added to the result linked list. The algorithm also handles cases where the linked lists have different lengths or a carry is left after the addition.

1. Initialize three pointers:
   - `l3` and `last` to keep track of the resultant linked list being created.
   - `carry` to store the carry generated during addition.

2. Iterate through both linked lists while either of them is not null:
   - Get the values of the current nodes in `l1` and `l2`. If a node is null, consider its value as 0.
   - Calculate the sum of the values along with the carry from the previous addition.
   - Calculate the new carry by dividing the sum by 10.
   - Update the sum by taking the remainder after division by 10.

3. Create a new node with the value of the calculated sum and link it to the `last` node.
   - If `l3` is null, assign `l3` and `last` to the newly created node.
   - If `l3` is not null, update the `next` pointer of the `last` node to point to the newly created node and move `last` to the new node.

4. Move the pointers `l1` and `l2` to their next nodes if they are not null.

5. After the main addition loop, check if there is any remaining carry.
   - If the carry is greater than 0, create a new node with the carry value and link it to the `last` node.

6. Return the resultant linked list `l3`.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm iterates through the linked lists while performing digit-wise addition and updating the carry. It efficiently creates the resultant linked list by adding new nodes as needed. The handling of carries and cases where one linked list is longer than the other ensures accurate addition.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm iterates through the linked lists once, performing constant-time operations for each digit addition. Therefore, the time complexity is O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of the input linked lists.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm utilizes extra space to store the resultant linked list. In the worst case, the space complexity is O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of the input linked lists.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code successfully adds two numbers represented as linked lists, accounting for carries and handling varying lengths. By iterating through the linked lists and performing digit-wise addition, the algorithm efficiently produces the required sum as a linked list.
