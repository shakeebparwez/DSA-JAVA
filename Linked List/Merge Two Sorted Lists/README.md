**Title: Merge Two Sorted Lists**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list while maintaining the order of elements. It follows a pointer-based approach to achieve the merging efficiently.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm iterates through both linked lists simultaneously and keeps adding nodes to the merged list in a way that maintains their sorted order.

1. Create a new pointer `list3` and a `last` pointer for the merged list initially set to `null`.

2. Compare the values of the first nodes of both `list1` and `list2`.
   - If the value of the first node of `list1` is smaller, set `list3` and `last` to point to that node, and move `list1` and detach its `next` pointer.
   - Otherwise, set `list3` and `last` to point to the first node of `list2`, move `list2`, and detach its `next` pointer.
   
3. Continue iterating and merging nodes until either of the linked lists becomes empty.
   - Compare the current nodes of `list1` and `list2` and attach the smaller one to the `last` node of the merged list. Move the respective list pointer and detach the `next` pointer of the added node.

4. After the loop ends, if any list remains non-empty, attach its remaining elements to the end of the merged list.

5. Return the `list3` pointer as the head of the merged linked list.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm efficiently merges two sorted linked lists by iteratively comparing the values of the nodes and connecting them to the merged list while maintaining their order. By using the `last` pointer, the algorithm avoids the need to traverse the merged list repeatedly.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm iterates through both linked lists once, performing constant-time operations for each node. Therefore, the time complexity is O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for maintaining pointers, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list while maintaining their order. By using pointers and avoiding unnecessary traversals, the algorithm achieves an efficient and practical solution to this problem.
