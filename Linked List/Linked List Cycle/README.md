**Title: Linked List Cycle**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to determine whether a linked list contains a cycle using a two-pointer approach. It utilizes two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) that traverse the linked list at different speeds to detect if they meet. If the pointers eventually meet, it indicates the presence of a cycle in the linked list.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm employs two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to traverse the linked list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, these two pointers will eventually meet at the same node. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list (`fast` becomes `null`).

1. Initialize both `slow` and `fast` pointers to point to the head of the linked list (`head`).
2. Iterate through the linked list using the `fast` pointer:
   - Move the `slow` pointer one step ahead (`slow = slow.next`).
   - Move the `fast` pointer two steps ahead (`fast = fast.next.next`).
   - If the `slow` and `fast` pointers become equal, it indicates the presence of a cycle. Return `true`.
   - Continue this process until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (`fast` becomes `null`).
3. If the `fast` pointer becomes `null`, it means there is no cycle in the linked list. Return `false`.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm leverages the differing speeds of the `slow` and `fast` pointers to determine whether a cycle exists in the linked list. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer, indicating that the linked list contains a cycle. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list without encountering the `slow` pointer.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm traverses the linked list at different speeds using the `slow` and `fast` pointers. In the worst case, where there is a cycle, the pointers will meet after at most N iterations (where N is the number of nodes). In the absence of a cycle, the algorithm traverses the entire linked list. Therefore, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to maintain the `slow` and `fast` pointers, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively detects whether a linked list contains a cycle using a two-pointer approach. By adjusting the speeds of the `slow` and `fast` pointers, the algorithm efficiently identifies the presence of a cycle in linear time while maintaining a constant space complexity.
