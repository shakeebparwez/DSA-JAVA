**Title: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to remove duplicate nodes from a sorted linked list. It uses a two-pointer approach, with one pointer (`slow`) traversing the list while another pointer (`fast`) helps remove duplicate nodes.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm iterates through the linked list using two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. The `slow` pointer is responsible for maintaining the unique nodes of the resulting list, while the `fast` pointer is used to traverse the list and identify duplicate nodes.

1. Initialize both `slow` and `fast` pointers to point to the head of the linked list (`head`).
2. Move the `fast` pointer one step ahead to start the comparison from the second node.
3. Iterate through the linked list using the `fast` pointer:
   - If the value of the current node (`fast.val`) is equal to the value of the previous node (`slow.val`), it indicates a duplicate.
     - Update the `slow.next` pointer to skip the duplicate node by pointing to `fast.next`.
     - Move the `fast` pointer ahead to the next node.
   - If the values are not equal, it's a unique node:
     - Increment both `slow` and `fast` pointers to move them forward in the list.
4. Continue the iteration until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (`fast` becomes `null`).

**Explanation:**
The algorithm compares adjacent nodes using the `fast` and `slow` pointers. When a duplicate node is encountered, the `slow.next` pointer is updated to skip that node, effectively removing it from the list. The `fast` pointer continues traversing the list, and the `slow` pointer maintains the resulting list with unique nodes.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm traverses the linked list exactly once, performing constant-time comparisons and node removals. Therefore, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code successfully removes duplicate nodes from a sorted linked list using a two-pointer approach. By adjusting pointers based on value comparisons, the algorithm maintains a resulting list with unique nodes while achieving efficient linear time complexity.
