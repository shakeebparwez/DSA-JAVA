**Title: Delete a Node in Single Linked List**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to delete a node at a specified position `x` in a singly linked list.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm follows these main steps:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Initialize two pointers: `curr` to traverse the linked list and `prev` to keep track of the previous node.

2. **Delete First Node:**
   - If `x` is 1, it means the first node needs to be deleted. In this case, increment the `curr` pointer to the next node, update the `head` pointer, and set the `next` pointer of the original head to `null`.

3. **Delete Non-First Node:**
   - For any position other than the first (i.e., `x` > 1), traverse the linked list using `curr` and `prev` pointers until `count` reaches `x`. This brings `curr` to the node to be deleted and `prev` to the node before it.

4. **Adjust Pointers:**
   - To delete the node, update the `next` pointer of the `prev` node to point to the `next` node of the `curr` node. Set the `next` pointer of the `curr` node to `null` to detach it from the linked list.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm effectively handles two cases: deleting the first node and deleting a non-first node. It adjusts the pointers to remove the desired node from the linked list.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm traverses the linked list at most once, resulting in a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables and pointer manipulation, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers a simple and efficient solution to delete a node at a specified position in a singly linked list. It adjusts the pointers to maintain the linked list's integrity after the deletion.
