**Title: Delete Node in a Linked List**

**Introduction:**
The provided code demonstrates a way to delete a node from a singly linked list by overwriting its value and updating the pointers to skip the node to be deleted. This approach specifically targets the given node and aims to maintain the structure and integrity of the linked list.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm takes advantage of the fact that we are not required to delete the given node itself, but rather the node following it. It achieves this by copying the value of the next node into the given node, effectively making the given node take on the role of the next node. Then, the algorithm updates the pointers to skip the next node, effectively removing it from the linked list.

1. Retrieve the value of the next node and store it in a variable (`data`).
2. Copy the value of `data` into the `val` attribute of the given node, essentially replacing its value.
3. Update the `next` pointer of the given node to point to the node after the next node, thus bypassing the next node.
4. As a result, the next node is effectively removed from the linked list.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm provides a creative approach to deleting a node from a linked list without explicitly deleting it. By copying the value of the next node and then skipping it through pointer manipulation, the algorithm effectively achieves the desired node removal.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm performs a constant number of operations, which includes copying values and updating pointers. Thus, the time complexity is O(1).
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for storing variables, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code demonstrates a clever approach to deleting a node from a singly linked list by overwriting its value and updating pointers, effectively achieving the node removal while maintaining the structure of the linked list.
