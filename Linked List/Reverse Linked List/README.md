**Title: Reverse Linked List**

**Introduction:**
The provided code tackles the task of reversing a singly linked list using both iterative and recursive approaches.

**Algorithm - Iterative Approach:**
1. Initialize three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `fast`. Set `prev` and `curr` to `null` and `fast` to the `head` of the linked list.
2. Iterate using the `fast` pointer until it reaches the end of the list (`null`).
3. Within each iteration:
   - Update `prev` to `curr`.
   - Update `curr` to `fast`.
   - Move `fast` to the next node (`fast.next`).
   - Reverse the link of `curr` to point to `prev`.
4. Return the `curr` pointer as the new head of the reversed linked list.

**Algorithm - Recursive Approach:**
1. Create a helper function that takes two arguments: `prev` (the previous node) and `curr` (the current node).
2. Base case: If `curr` is `null`, return `prev` as the new head of the reversed list.
3. Store the next node in a variable `nextNode`.
4. Reverse the link of `curr` to point to `prev`.
5. Recursively call the function with arguments `curr` and `nextNode`.
6. In the main `reverseList` function, set `prev` to `null` and `curr` to the original `head`.
7. Call the recursive function with `prev` and `curr`, and set the returned value as the new head.

**Explanation:**
Both approaches reverse the direction of links in the linked list, resulting in a reversal of the entire list. The iterative approach iterates through the list while updating pointers and links, effectively reversing the list. The recursive approach uses function calls and reverses links recursively while returning the new head.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Iterative Approach:
  - Time Complexity: The iterative approach traverses the entire list once, performing constant-time operations in each iteration. Hence, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
  - Space Complexity: The iterative approach uses a constant amount of additional memory for the pointers, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

- Recursive Approach:
  - Time Complexity: The recursive approach also traverses the entire list once, with each operation taking constant time. The recursive calls introduce additional function call overhead, resulting in a time complexity of O(N).
  - Space Complexity: The recursive approach uses the call stack to manage the recursive function calls. In the worst case, the maximum depth of the call stack would be the number of nodes in the linked list, resulting in a space complexity of O(N).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code offers two solutions to reversing a singly linked list: one using an iterative approach and the other using a recursive approach. Both methods efficiently reverse the linked list by reversing the direction of links, and they provide different perspectives on solving the problem. The iterative approach offers simplicity and constant space complexity, while the recursive approach employs function calls and may be useful in scenarios where recursive solutions are preferred.
