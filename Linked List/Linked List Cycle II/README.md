**Title: Linked List Cycle II**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to detect and find the starting node of a cycle in a linked list using the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm. Once a cycle is detected, the algorithm determines the node where the cycle begins based on certain observations.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm uses two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to traverse the linked list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, these two pointers will eventually meet at the same node.

1. Initialize both `slow` and `fast` pointers to point to the head of the linked list (`head`).
2. Iterate through the linked list using the `fast` pointer:
   - Move the `slow` pointer one step ahead (`slow = slow.next`).
   - Move the `fast` pointer two steps ahead (`fast = fast.next.next`).
   - If the `slow` and `fast` pointers become equal, it indicates the presence of a cycle. Break out of the loop.
   - Continue this process until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (`fast` becomes `null`).
3. If the `fast` pointer becomes `null`, it means there is no cycle in the linked list. Return `null`.
4. Once a cycle is detected:
   - Reset the `slow` pointer to the head of the linked list (`head`).
   - Move both the `slow` and `fast` pointers one step at a time until they meet again. This point of meeting will be the starting node of the cycle.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm employs the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm to detect the presence of a cycle in the linked list. After detecting the cycle, it uses certain observations to determine the starting node of the cycle. By resetting the `slow` pointer to the head of the linked list and moving both pointers one step at a time, the algorithm identifies the node where the cycle begins.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm traverses the linked list twice. The first traversal to detect the cycle takes linear time (O(N)), and the second traversal to find the starting node of the cycle also takes linear time (O(N)), resulting in a total time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to maintain the `slow` and `fast` pointers, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively detects the presence of a cycle in a linked list using the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm. Additionally, it determines the starting node of the cycle based on observations derived from the relative speeds of the `slow` and `fast` pointers. The algorithm's efficiency and constant space complexity make it a practical approach for solving this problem.
