**Title: Two Sum**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to find and return the indices of two numbers in the given array `nums` that add up to the specified `target` value.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm employs a hashmap to store each number along with its index while iterating through the array. This hashmap is utilized to quickly check if the required complement (difference between the target and the current number) is present in the array.

1. Initialize an array `ans` of size 2 to store the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target.

2. Initialize a variable `complement` to store the value that, when subtracted from the current number, yields the target value.

3. Create a hashmap named `map` to store each number encountered in the array along with its index.

4. Iterate through the array:
   - Calculate the complement required to reach the target (`target - nums[i]`).
   - Check if the complement is present in the `map`. If it is, retrieve its index and set it as the first element of the `ans` array. Set the current index `i` as the second element of the `ans` array.
   - If the complement is not present in the `map`, store the current number along with its index in the `map` for future reference.

5. Return the `ans` array containing the indices of the two numbers.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm utilizes a hashmap to efficiently search for the required complement value within the array. By storing each number along with its index in the hashmap, the algorithm can quickly identify if the complement is present and retrieve its index, which represents the second number needed to achieve the target sum.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm iterates through the array once and performs constant-time operations while interacting with the hashmap. As a result, the overall time complexity is O(N), where N is the size of the array.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses additional space to store numbers and their indices in the hashmap. In the worst case, the hashmap can store all the numbers, resulting in a space complexity of O(N).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively finds and returns the indices of two numbers in the given array that add up to the specified target value. By utilizing a hashmap to store numbers and their indices, the algorithm identifies the required complement efficiently, leading to a linear time complexity.
