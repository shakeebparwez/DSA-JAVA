**Title: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to find a pair of numbers in a sorted array that sum up to a given target value. The solution uses a two-pointer approach to efficiently search for the desired pair.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm employs a two-pointer approach, with one pointer (`low`) starting from the beginning of the array and another pointer (`high`) starting from the end of the array. Since the array is sorted in ascending order, the algorithm exploits this property to efficiently find the pair.

1. Initialize the `low` pointer to the beginning of the array (index 0) and the `high` pointer to the end of the array (`N - 1`), where `N` is the length of the array.

2. Iterate while the `low` pointer is less than the `high` pointer:
   - Calculate the sum of the numbers at indices `low` and `high`.
   - If the sum is equal to the target value:
     - Store the indices (1-indexed) of the pair in the `ans` array and break out of the loop.
   - If the sum is less than the target value, increment the `low` pointer to explore larger values.
   - If the sum is greater than the target value, decrement the `high` pointer to explore smaller values.

3. After the iteration, the `ans` array contains the indices of the pair that sums up to the target value.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm leverages the sorted nature of the array to efficiently search for the required pair of numbers using the two-pointer approach. By adjusting the pointers based on the sum comparison with the target value, the algorithm effectively identifies the pair.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm traverses the array once, performing constant-time operations for each comparison. Therefore, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to store the `ans` array, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code successfully finds a pair of numbers in a sorted array that sum up to the given target value using the two-pointer approach. By exploiting the sorted nature of the array, the algorithm achieves efficient linear time complexity.
