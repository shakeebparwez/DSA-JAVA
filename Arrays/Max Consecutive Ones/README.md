**Title: Max Consecutive Ones**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to find the maximum number of consecutive ones in a given binary array.

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm iterates through the input array and keeps track of the maximum consecutive count of ones encountered so far.

1. Initialize two variables: `i` to traverse the array and `max_consecutive_count` to store the maximum consecutive count of ones.
2. While `i` is within the bounds of the array:
   - Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the consecutive ones count in the current iteration.
   - Inside a nested loop, while `i` is within bounds and the current element is `1`:
     - Increment the `count` variable.
     - Increment `i` to move to the next element.
   - Update `max_consecutive_count` to the maximum of its current value and the `count` obtained in the current iteration.
   - Increment `i` once more to move beyond the current consecutive sequence of ones.
3. Return `max_consecutive_count` as the result.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm scans through the input array while counting consecutive ones in each iteration. The maximum consecutive count of ones encountered so far is stored in the `max_consecutive_count` variable. After each iteration, this value is updated if a larger count is found. This ensures that the algorithm keeps track of the longest sequence of consecutive ones.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm traverses the array once, performing constant-time operations in each iteration. Hence, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input array.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of additional memory for variables, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively determines the maximum number of consecutive ones in the given binary array. By keeping track of the consecutive ones count and updating the maximum count, the algorithm efficiently identifies the longest sequence of consecutive ones in the array.
