**Title: Pascal's Triangle**

**Introduction:**
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each row of the triangle represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)^n, where 'a' and 'b' are constants and 'n' is the row number (0-indexed).

**Algorithm:**
The algorithm generates Pascal's Triangle row by row, leveraging the property that each element in a row is the sum of the two elements above it in the previous row.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a 2D list called `pascalTriangle` to store the triangle.
   - Add the first row `[1]` to `pascalTriangle`.

2. **Generating Rows:**
   - Iterate from `2` to `numRows` (both inclusive) to generate each row.
   - For each row:
     - Create an `ArrayList<Integer>` called `temp` to store the row's elements.
     - Get the index of the last row in `pascalTriangle`.
     - For each element in the new row:
       - Calculate two values, `numOne` and `numTwo`, by referencing the elements above and diagonally above in the last row.
       - Add the sum of `numOne` and `numTwo` to the `temp` list.

3. **Adding Rows:**
   - After generating a new row, add the `temp` list to the `pascalTriangle`.

4. **Return:**
   - After generating all the rows, return the `pascalTriangle`.

**Explanation:**
The algorithm constructs Pascal's Triangle by iteratively generating each row based on the previous row's elements. For each element, it calculates the sum of the two elements directly above it, which is a characteristic property of Pascal's Triangle. The algorithm efficiently utilizes the information from the previous row to calculate the new elements.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: The algorithm generates `numRows` rows, with each row having elements equal to its row number. As a result, the time complexity is O(numRows^2).
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses additional space to store the generated Pascal's Triangle, resulting in a space complexity of O(numRows^2).

**Conclusion:**
The provided solution effectively constructs Pascal's Triangle by iteratively generating each row based on the previous row's elements. The algorithm leverages the mathematical property of the triangle to efficiently calculate and populate the elements. This approach avoids redundant calculations and ensures that the time complexity remains reasonable for practical purposes.
