The provided code is a solution to the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem, which involves finding the length of the longest substring within a given string `s` that does not contain any repeating characters.

Here's how the code works:

1. Initialize three variables: `i`, `j`, and `ans`. `i` and `j` are used to define the current substring, and `ans` stores the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

2. Create a `HashMap` named `map` to keep track of characters in the current substring and their positions in the string.

3. The code uses a sliding window approach to iterate through the string. The window is defined by the indices `i` and `j`, and it slides to the right to explore different substrings.

4. In the `while` loop, the code checks if the character at index `j` is not present in the `map` (meaning it has not been encountered in the current substring). If it's not in the map, it adds the character to the map with a value of 1 (indicating its presence) and updates the `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` value and the length of the current substring (`j - i + 1`).

5. If the character at index `j` is already in the `map`, indicating a repeating character, the code starts to shrink the window from the left side by moving `i` one character to the right. It also updates the count of the character at index `i` in the `map`.

6. If the count of the character at index `i` becomes 0 (meaning it's no longer in the substring), it is removed from the `map`.

7. The process continues, and the window is adjusted as it iterates through the string.

8. Finally, the code returns the value of `ans`, which represents the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

The code efficiently finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string using a sliding window and a `HashMap` for character tracking. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
