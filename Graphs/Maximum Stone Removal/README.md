**Title: Maximum Stone Removal**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to find the maximum number of stones that can be safely removed from a given grid of stones, satisfying the condition that a stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed. The code employs the Disjoint Set data structure to efficiently group stones and determine the number of removable stones.

**Maximum Stone Removal Algorithm:**

1. **Solution Class:**
   - Implements the `maxRemove` function to calculate the maximum number of stones that can be safely removed.

2. **Finding Maximum Dimensions:**
   - Initializes `maxRow` and `maxCol` to keep track of the maximum row and column values from the given `stones` array.
   - Iterates through each stone and updates `maxRow` and `maxCol` based on the stone's coordinates.

3. **Initializing Disjoint Set:**
   - Initializes a `DisjointSet` instance `ds` with the size of the disjoint set data structure.
   - The size is determined by `maxRow + 1` (to accommodate row nodes) and `maxCol + 1` (to accommodate column nodes).

4. **Creating Stone Nodes:**
   - Initializes a `HashSet<Integer>` named `stoneNodes` to keep track of nodes that correspond to stones.
   - Iterates through each stone in the `stones` array.
   - Converts the stone's row and column into node indices by adding `maxRow + 1` to the column value.
   - Performs a union by size operation between the node corresponding to the stone's row and the node corresponding to the stone's column.
   - Adds both the row and column nodes to the `stoneNodes` set.

5. **Counting Components:**
   - Initializes `count` to keep track of the number of components.
   - Iterates through each node in the `stoneNodes` set.
   - Checks if the ultimate parent of the node (found using `findUPar` method) is the same as the node itself.
   - If the condition is met, increments the `count` as it represents a separate component.

6. **Calculating Maximum Removal:**
   - Calculates the maximum number of removable stones using the formula `n - count`.
   - The derivation is based on the fact that from every component having `n` stones, `n - 1` stones can be safely removed while satisfying the given condition.
   - Returns the calculated maximum removal.

**Explanation:**
The code efficiently employs the Disjoint Set data structure to group stones based on their shared rows and columns. By performing union operations, the code determines the number of connected components in the grid of stones. The final result is obtained by calculating the maximum number of stones that can be safely removed from each connected component.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively calculates the maximum number of stones that can be safely removed from the given grid, satisfying the specified condition. By utilizing the Disjoint Set data structure, the code efficiently handles grouping of stones and computing the maximum removable stones. The result provides insights into the potential number of stones that can be safely removed while satisfying the given condition.
