**Title: Cheapest Flights Within K Stops using BFS**

**Introduction:**
This code solves the problem of finding the cheapest flight cost from a source to a destination within a given number of stops (k) in a directed graph. Each flight has an associated cost, and the goal is to find the minimum cost to reach the destination.

**Components:**

1. **Pair Class:**
   - A simple class to hold pairs of integers.
   - Contains a constructor to initialize the pair.

2. **Tuple Class:**
   - A class to store a triple of integers representing stops, node, and cost.
   - Contains a constructor to initialize the tuple.

3. **Solution Class:**
   - Contains the main logic for finding the cheapest flight cost.
   - Utilizes BFS to explore possible flights and update the costs.

**Algorithm Overview:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an adjacency list representation (`adj`) of the graph.
   - Initialize a BFS queue (`q`) with the source node and zero cost.
   - Create an array (`costs`) to store the minimum costs to reach each node, initialized with maximum values except for the source node.

2. **BFS Exploration:**
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a tuple.
   - If the number of stops is greater than k, skip the current node.
   - For each adjacent node, calculate the new cost and check if it's smaller than the existing cost:
     - If it is, update the cost, enqueue the tuple, and increment stops.
   - Continue this process until all possible paths are explored.

3. **Result:**
   - If the cost to reach the destination is still the maximum value, return -1 (unreachable).
   - Otherwise, return the minimum cost to reach the destination.

**Revised Code Summary:**

1. Import necessary packages.

2. Define the `Pair` class.

3. Define the `Tuple` class.

4. Define the `Solution` class:
   - Implement the `CheapestFlight` method with parameters `n`, `flights`, `src`, `dst`, and `k`.
   - Initialize an adjacency list (`adj`) representation of the graph.
   - Initialize BFS queue (`q`), costs array, and initialize source node cost.
   - Implement BFS exploration:
     - Skip nodes with more than k stops.
     - Update costs if smaller cost is found.
     - Enqueue adjacent nodes with updated costs.
   - Return minimum cost to reach the destination or -1 if unreachable.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively solves the problem of finding the cheapest flight cost from a source to a destination within a given number of stops using BFS. It iterates through possible flight paths, updating costs as needed, and ultimately returns the minimum cost required to reach the destination or -1 if unreachable.
