**Title: Articulation Points in a Graph (Part I)**

**Introduction:**
The provided code implements an algorithm to identify articulation points in an undirected graph using Depth-First Search (DFS). Articulation points, also known as cut vertices, are nodes in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components.

**Articulation Point Algorithm Steps (DFS-based):**

1. **DFS Function:**
   - Implements the `dfs` function to traverse the graph and identify articulation points.
   - Accepts the current node, its parent (to avoid backtracking), arrays to track visited nodes, discovery times, lowest accessible times, articulation points, and the graph (`adj`).
   - Marks the current node as visited and timestamps its discovery and low times.
   - Increments the global time counter.
   - Initializes a count `child` to track the number of child nodes in the DFS traversal.

2. **DFS Body:**
   - Iterates through the adjacent nodes of the current node.
   - If the adjacent node is the parent node, skips the iteration.
   - If the adjacent node is unvisited, calls the `dfs` function recursively on it.
   - On return, updates the lowest accessible time for the current node.
   - Checks for the articulation point condition:
     - If the lowest accessible time of the adjacent node is greater than or equal to the discovery time of the current node and the parent node is not the root (-1), marks the current node as an articulation point.
   - Increments the `child` count if the adjacent node was visited.

3. **Handling Parent Node:**
   - If the current node is a parent (root) with more than one child, marks it as an articulation point.
   - This condition is checked to cover cases where the root itself is an articulation point if it has more than one child.

4. **Main Function:**
   - Implements the `articulationPoints` function to identify articulation points in the graph.
   - Initializes arrays for visited nodes, discovery times, lowest accessible times, and articulation points.
   - Calls the `dfs` function for unvisited nodes to identify articulation points.
   - Collects the identified articulation points in the `ans` ArrayList.
   - If no articulation points are found, adds `-1` to the answer list.

**Explanation:**
The code effectively utilizes DFS traversal to identify articulation points in an undirected graph. By tracking discovery and low times for each node and considering the articulation point conditions, the algorithm accurately identifies nodes that, when removed, will increase the number of connected components in the graph.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code successfully implements an algorithm to identify articulation points in an undirected graph using Depth-First Search. It effectively tracks discovery and low times, as well as checks for conditions that indicate whether a node is an articulation point. The result is an ArrayList containing identified articulation points or `-1` if no articulation points are found.
