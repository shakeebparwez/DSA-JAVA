**Title: Path With Minimum Effort using Dijkstra's Algorithm**

**Introduction:**
This code solves the problem of finding the path with the minimum effort from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in a 2D grid. The effort required to move between adjacent cells is defined as the absolute difference in heights between the cells.

**Components:**

1. **Tuple Class:**
   - A class to store a triple of integers representing effort, row, and column.
   - Contains a constructor to initialize the tuple.

2. **Comparator Class (My):**
   - Implements the `Comparator` interface to define custom ordering for tuples based on effort.

3. **Solution Class:**
   - Contains the main logic for finding the path with minimum effort.
   - Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue to explore paths and update the minimum effort.

**Algorithm Overview:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a priority queue (`pq`) with custom comparator to manage tuples by their effort.
   - Initialize the effort matrix with maximum values except for the source cell.
   - Enqueue the source cell tuple with effort 0.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
   - Define delta arrays for possible movements: `deltaRow` and `deltaCol`.
   - While the priority queue is not empty, dequeue a tuple.
   - Check if the current cell is the destination; return effort if true.
   - For each of the four possible directions, calculate new row and column.
   - If the new cell is within bounds, calculate new effort and update the matrix:
     - Calculate effort as the maximum of current effort and height difference.
     - If new effort is less than existing effort, update matrix and enqueue the new tuple.

3. **Result:**
   - Return the minimum effort required to reach the destination.

**Revised Code Summary:**

1. Import necessary packages.

2. Define the `Tuple` class.

3. Define the `My` class to implement the comparator.

4. Define the `Solution` class:
   - Implement the `MinimumEffort` method with parameter `heights`.
   - Initialize a priority queue and effort matrix.
   - Implement Dijkstra's algorithm using priority queue:
     - Update effort for adjacent cells if new effort is smaller.
     - Enqueue updated tuples into the priority queue.
   - Return the minimum effort required to reach the destination.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively solves the problem of finding the path with the minimum effort in a 2D grid using Dijkstra's algorithm. By iteratively updating the effort matrix based on height differences, the algorithm determines the minimum effort required to move from the source cell to the destination cell.
