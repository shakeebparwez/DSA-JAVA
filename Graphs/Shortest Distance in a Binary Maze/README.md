**Title: Shortest Distance in a Binary Maze using BFS**

**Introduction:**
This code solves the problem of finding the shortest path between a source and a destination in a binary maze using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The maze is represented as a 2D grid where cells contain either obstacles (0) or open paths (1).

**Components:**

1. **Tuple Class:**
   - A class to store a triple of integers representing distance, row, and column.
   - Contains a constructor to initialize the tuple.

2. **Solution Class:**
   - Contains the main logic for finding the shortest path.
   - Utilizes BFS to explore the maze and determine the shortest distance.

**Algorithm Overview:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - If the source and destination are the same, return 0.
   - Create a queue to perform BFS.
   - Initialize the distance matrix with maximum values except for the source cell.
   - Enqueue the source cell tuple with distance 0.

2. **BFS Exploration:**
   - Define delta arrays for possible movements: `deltaRow` and `deltaCol`.
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a tuple.
   - For each of the four possible directions, calculate new row and column.
   - If the new cell is within bounds, is an open path, and offers a shorter distance, update the distance matrix and enqueue the new tuple.
   - If the destination cell is reached, return the distance.

3. **Result:**
   - If the destination cell is not reachable, return -1.

**Revised Code Summary:**

1. Import necessary packages.

2. Define the `Tuple` class.

3. Define the `Solution` class:
   - Implement the `shortestPath` method with parameters `grid`, `source`, and `destination`.
   - Check if source and destination are the same; return 0 if true.
   - Initialize a BFS queue and distance matrix.
   - Perform BFS exploration using delta arrays:
     - Enqueue tuples with updated distance and valid neighbors.
     - If destination is reached, return the distance.
   - Return -1 if destination is not reachable.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code efficiently solves the problem of finding the shortest distance between a source and destination in a binary maze using BFS. It iterates through the maze, considering valid movements, and maintains a distance matrix to keep track of the shortest distance to each cell. If the destination is reachable, the algorithm returns the shortest distance; otherwise, it returns -1.
