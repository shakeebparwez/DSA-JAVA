**Title: Counting Provinces using Disjoint Set**

**Introduction:**
The given code uses a disjoint set data structure to determine the number of provinces in a given graph. Each province is a connected component in the graph. The code initializes a disjoint set data structure, processes the adjacency matrix, and counts the number of ultimate parent nodes to determine the provinces.

**Components:**

1. **Solution Class:**
   - Implements the `numProvinces` function to count the number of provinces in a given graph.
   - Uses the `DisjointSet` data structure for efficient component identification.

2. **numProvinces Function:**
   - Takes an adjacency list representation of a graph and the number of vertices (`V`) as inputs.
   - Initializes a `DisjointSet` instance with `V` vertices.

3. **Union by Size:**
   - Loops through the adjacency matrix to establish connections between vertices using `unionBySize` method.

4. **Count Provinces:**
   - Loops through all vertices (0 to `V - 1`).
   - If the ultimate parent of a vertex is itself (`findUPar(i) == i`), it indicates that the vertex is the representative of its component, and thus, a new province is encountered. Increment the `count`.

5. **Return Province Count:**
   - Returns the total count of provinces.

**Explanation:**
The code first initializes a disjoint set data structure. It then iterates through the adjacency matrix and uses the `unionBySize` method to establish connections between vertices with a value of `1` in the adjacency matrix. This step groups vertices into connected components.

After that, it counts the number of ultimate parent nodes (representatives) in the disjoint set data structure. Each ultimate parent node represents a separate province. Finally, it returns the count of provinces in the graph.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively determines the number of provinces (connected components) in a given graph using the disjoint set data structure. It establishes connections based on the adjacency matrix and counts the ultimate parent nodes to find the provinces. This algorithm efficiently identifies connected components and provides an accurate count of provinces in the graph.
