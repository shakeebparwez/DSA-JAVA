**Title: Strongly Connected Components using Tarjan's Algorithm**

**Introduction:**
The provided code implements Tarjan's algorithm to find strongly connected components (SCCs) in a given directed graph. Tarjan's algorithm is a graph traversal and depth-first search (DFS) based algorithm that effectively identifies SCCs and organizes them in the correct order.

**Tarjan's Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Comparator Class:**
   - Defines a `My` class implementing the `Comparator` interface to sort ArrayLists based on their first element.
   - The `compare` method returns the result of comparing the first elements of two ArrayLists.

2. **DFS for SCCs:**
   - Implements the `dfs` function to perform the main DFS traversal for finding SCCs using Tarjan's algorithm.
   - Initializes the discovery and low arrays with `-1` to track discovery and low times.
   - Initializes a stack (`stk`) to keep track of nodes present in SCCs.
   - Initializes an array `inStack` to keep track of nodes in the stack.
   - For each node in the graph, if the node is unvisited, calls the `dfs` function to find SCCs.

3. **DFS Body:**
   - Initializes the discovery and low times for the current node.
   - Marks the node as visited and pushes it into the stack.
   - Increments the global time counter.
   - Iterates through the adjacent nodes of the current node.
   - If the adjacent node is unvisited, recursively calls `dfs` on it and updates the low time of the current node.
   - If the adjacent node is in the stack, updates the low time of the current node with the discovery time of the adjacent node (handles back edges).

4. **Finding SCC:**
   - When the lowest accessible time and discovery time of a node are equal, it means the current node is the parent of an SCC.
   - Pops nodes from the stack and adds them to a temporary ArrayList until the parent node is encountered.
   - Sorts the temporary ArrayList to maintain the required order of SCCs.
   - Adds the SCC to the `ans` ArrayList.

5. **Main Function:**
   - Implements the `tarjans` function to find SCCs in the given graph.
   - Initializes discovery, low, and inStack arrays, as well as a stack (`stk`) and the answer ArrayList (`ans`).
   - Calls the `dfs` function for unvisited nodes to identify SCCs.
   - Sorts the `ans` ArrayList using the `My` comparator class.

**Explanation:**
The code effectively utilizes Tarjan's algorithm to find strongly connected components in a directed graph. It performs DFS-based traversal and maintains various arrays to track discovery times, low times, and nodes present in SCCs. By following the steps of Tarjan's algorithm, the code identifies SCCs and ensures they are sorted according to the question's requirement.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code successfully implements Tarjan's algorithm to find strongly connected components in a directed graph. By performing DFS traversal and utilizing the discovery and low time tracking techniques, the algorithm accurately identifies SCCs and sorts them. The result provides insights into the structural connectivity of the graph and presents the SCCs in the specified order.
