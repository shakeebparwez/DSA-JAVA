**Title: Minimum Multiplications to Reach End using BFS**

**Introduction:**
This code solves the problem of finding the minimum number of multiplications required to transform a starting number to an ending number using a given set of multiplication factors. The goal is to determine the minimum number of steps needed to reach the ending number by multiplying the starting number with the available factors.

**Components:**

1. **Pair Class:**
   - A simple class to hold pairs of integers.
   - Contains a constructor to initialize the pair.

2. **Solution Class:**
   - Contains the main logic for finding the minimum multiplications.
   - Utilizes BFS to explore possible multiplication paths and determine the minimum steps.

**Algorithm Overview:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a BFS queue (`q`) with a pair of steps and the starting number.
   - Create an array (`results`) to store the minimum steps needed to reach each possible result of multiplication, initialized with maximum values except for the starting number.
   - Set the result at the starting number to 0.

2. **BFS Exploration:**
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a pair.
   - For each multiplication factor in the given array:
     - Calculate the new result of multiplication.
     - If the number of steps to reach this new result is less than the existing steps, update the results array.
     - If the new result is the ending number, return the steps.
     - Enqueue the new pair into the queue.

3. **Result:**
   - If the ending number is unreachable, return -1.
   - Otherwise, return the minimum number of steps needed to reach the ending number.

**Revised Code Summary:**

1. Import necessary packages.

2. Define the `Pair` class.

3. Define the `Solution` class:
   - Implement the `minimumMultiplications` method with parameters `arr`, `start`, and `end`.
   - Initialize BFS queue (`q`), results array, and initialize result for the starting number.
   - Implement BFS exploration:
     - Update results if smaller steps are found to reach a new multiplication result.
     - Return steps if ending number is reached.
   - Return the minimum number of steps or -1 if unreachable.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively solves the problem of finding the minimum number of multiplications required to reach an ending number using BFS. It explores possible multiplication paths and determines the minimum steps needed to reach the ending number or returns -1 if it's unreachable.
