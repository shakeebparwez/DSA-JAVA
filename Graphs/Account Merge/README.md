**Title: Account Merge**

**Introduction:**
The provided code aims to merge user accounts with the same email addresses, ultimately creating a list of merged accounts while maintaining user information. It uses the Disjoint Set data structure to efficiently identify and merge accounts with common email addresses.

**Account Merge Algorithm:**

1. **Solution Class:**
   - Implements the `accountsMerge` function to merge user accounts based on common email addresses.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Initializes `N` with the number of accounts in the input list.
   - Initializes a `DisjointSet` instance `ds` with `N` nodes.
   - Initializes a HashMap `mapMailToNode` to map email addresses to the corresponding node index.

3. **Mapping Emails:**
   - Iterates through each account (represented as a list of strings).
   - For each account, iterates through email addresses (starting from index 1).
   - Checks if the `mapMailToNode` contains the current email.
     - If not present, adds the email as a key and its corresponding account index as the value to the map.
     - If the email is already in the map, performs a union by size operation between the account index and the value associated with the email key in the map.

4. **Merging Accounts:**
   - Creates an array of ArrayLists named `mergedMail`, with each index representing an account.
   - Iterates through the entries in `mapMailToNode`.
   - Retrieves the ultimate parent node using the `findUPar` method and associates the email with that parent node index in the `mergedMail` array.

5. **Creating Merged Accounts List:**
   - Initializes a list named `ans` to store the merged accounts.
   - Iterates through each account (represented as a list of strings).
     - If the account has no merged emails, continues to the next iteration.
     - Sorts the merged emails associated with the current account.
     - Creates a temporary list named `temp` to store the merged account information.
     - Adds the user's name (first element of the account list) to `temp`.
     - Adds each merged email to `temp`.
     - Adds `temp` to the `ans` list.

6. **Returning Merged Accounts:**
   - Returns the `ans` list containing the merged accounts.

**Explanation:**
The code uses the Disjoint Set data structure to merge accounts based on common email addresses. It iterates through each account and email, creating associations between emails and account indexes using the `mapMailToNode` HashMap. It then merges accounts with common emails using the `unionBySize` method. After merging, it creates a list of merged emails for each account index using the `mergedMail` array. The final step involves sorting and formatting the merged accounts, which are then stored in the `ans` list for return.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code is effective in merging user accounts with common email addresses. It leverages the Disjoint Set data structure to efficiently manage the merging process and create a list of merged accounts while preserving user information. The code successfully handles the merging of accounts with different email associations and produces a clear and organized list of merged accounts for further analysis or presentation.
