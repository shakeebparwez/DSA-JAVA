**Title: Distance from the Source (Bellman-Ford Algorithm)**

**Introduction:**
This code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest distances from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It also checks for the presence of negative cycles.

**Components:**

1. **Solution Class:**
   - Contains the main logic for the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
   - Utilizes two iterations to relax edges and check for negative cycles.

**Algorithm Overview:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an array `dist` to store the shortest distances from the source to each node. Initialize distances with a large value (`1e8`).
   - Set the distance from the source node (`S`) to itself as 0.

2. **Bellman-Ford Iteration:**
   - Perform the Bellman-Ford algorithm using two iterations:
     - For `V - 1` iterations:
       - For each edge in the `edges` list, update distances if a shorter path is found.
     - For each edge again:
       - If a shorter path exists, it indicates a negative cycle. Return a special marker (array with `-1`).

3. **Result:**
   - If no negative cycle is detected, return the `dist` array with the shortest distances to each node.

**Revised Code Summary:**

1. Define the `Solution` class.

2. Implement the `bellman_ford` method with parameters `V`, `edges`, and `S`.
   - Initialize the `dist` array with large values and set distance from source to source as 0.
   - Perform the Bellman-Ford algorithm with two iterations.
     - Relax edges and update distances if shorter paths are found.
   - Check for negative cycles.
     - If found, return a special marker.
   - Return the `dist` array.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code effectively implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest distances from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It also includes a check for the presence of negative cycles. The algorithm works in two iterations, with the first iteration relaxing edges and the second iteration checking for negative cycles.
