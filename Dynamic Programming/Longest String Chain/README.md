The provided code is a solution to the "Longest String Chain" problem, which involves finding the length of the longest possible string chain within a given list of words. A string chain is a sequence of words `word_1, word_2, ..., word_k` where each word is a previous word with one character changed.

Here's how the code works:

1. The code begins by creating a custom comparator `My` that compares strings based on their lengths. The `compare` method is used to compare two strings first by length and, in case of equal length, lexicographically.

2. The code defines a function `isPossible` that checks if a smaller string `s1` can be formed from a larger string `s2` by removing exactly one character from `s1`. It ensures that the length difference between `s1` and `s2` is exactly 1, and the characters match as expected.

3. The `solve` function is a recursive function used to find the length of the longest string chain starting from a given index `ind`. It keeps track of the index of the previous word (`prevInd`) and the list of words. The function uses dynamic programming for memoization.

4. Inside the `solve` function, two cases are considered:
   - `notTake`: The current word is not included in the chain. It calculates the result without considering the current word and proceeds to the next word.
   - `take`: The current word is included in the chain. It checks if the current word can be a part of the chain based on the `isPossible` function and proceeds to the next word with an updated index.

5. The code initializes a 2D array `dp` to store the computed results. The `dp` array is indexed by the current word's index (`ind`) and the previous word's index (`prevInd`).

6. The `longestStrChain` function sorts the input array of words based on length using the `My` comparator. It then initializes the `dp` array with -1 values for memoization.

7. The `longestStrChain` function calls the `solve` function with the initial values, starting from the first word (index 0) and without any previous word (indicated by -1). It returns the result as the length of the longest string chain.

The code correctly solves the "Longest String Chain" problem by considering two cases for each word: including it in the chain or not including it. The memoization (dynamic programming) using the `dp` array optimizes the solution by avoiding redundant computations.
